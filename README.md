# Cryptocurrency-Project2

I will be looking at cryptocurrency. Specifically, Cosmos, Bitcoin, and Dogecoin. I will be using datasets from Kaggle and data world. I will be needing to filter, clean and join the content. It will load into a relational database. The final tables will include trends of cryptocurrency prices from these three cryptos. Some of the data I donâ€™t care about is the marketcap.

Data World: https://query.data.world/s/cpfmzvxadcf6ynzriluhpyailqj4y4
Will focus on Bitcoin.
Kaggle: Various CSV Files
Will focus on Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Cosmos.
